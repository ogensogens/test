i. Variables are containers that store values. Languages where you have to label a variable to perform a task is a Statically typed languages- Java, C++. They work at compile time.  While languages where you do not need to assign a label to variables identitfy these at runtime are called dynamically typed languages like Python
ii. In statically typed langauges, variables are assigned by data types and are compiled by a compiler before execution. they are type safe, more optimized code but slower development cycle. While Dynamically typed languages variable types are not declared so you don't have a compiler but have an interpreter that executes at runtime. and as such can have type errors, less optimized coded and faster development cycle. 
Null and Undefined mean there is no value for the variable. Your function returns null when your vairable has been defined and has been checked and it doesn't find a value. While undefined means the variable has been defined but probably hasn't been assigned a value(it might have a value that just hasn't been specified) undefined == null is true ; undefined === null is false
